# net_analysis

Python scripts and Jupyter notebook for performing neighborhood enrichment (NET) analysis.

Modified from original code from Axel Andersson and Anna Klemm (https://github.com/axanderssonuu/SpatialEnrichmentTest)


## Usage

In the SpatialEnrichmentTest folder, there is a sample notebook `ArneOestman2021-1.ipynb` that you can run on the included CSV files. To adapt it for your own CSV data, you need to modify some of the paths and names in the notebook.
